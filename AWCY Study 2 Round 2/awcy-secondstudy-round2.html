<h3>User Study: Andy</h3>
<p>Stanford University is developing an open source privacy-protecting virtual assistant, called Andy. We'd like to know how interested you would be in using Andy.</p>	

<div> 
    <p>How concerned are you about privacy of smart assistants such as Alexa or Google Assistant? 
    On a scale of 1-4, where:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Not at all concerned</li>
        <li>A little concerned</li>
        <li>Concerned, but that’s the way it is. I will use it if it is useful.</li>
        <li>I’m so concerned about privacy that I will not use it even if I find it useful.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3> Instructions </h3>
    <p>Imagine you have just received a new open-source privacy-protecting assistant, called Andy, developed by Stanford University that is designed to protect your privacy. The assistant does all the most important functions that Alexa does. You turn it on. Fill out what you expect your first few examples of conversations do you expect.  
    Write down very different sentences of you would say or ask, and how you think the assitant should answer:</p>
    <p>Andy: Hello, how can I help you?</p>
    <p>User (you): RESPONSE</p>
    <p>Etc...</p>
